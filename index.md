> Wait, is that a windows phone?. Yes, I still use one . Fortunately there are still a decent amount of weather apps.
> This one comes as a default and I have stuck with it. Its pretty much standard stuff.
> It shows the temperature according to the day and hour of the day. The background changes according to the weather and
> time of the day. It can also show average high and low temperatures,humidity , precipitation and wind speed.
> Being a part of the windows eco system it has a neat live tile on the start screen that shows the current weather and daily forecast.
> 
> P.S: It also shows the moon phase.
